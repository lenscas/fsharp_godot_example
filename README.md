# fsharp_godot_example
This is an early snapshot of the dungeoncrawler game I am working on. It serves as an example project on how to make games with F# and Godot.

# Goal:
The goal of this project is NOT to be a full game or anything close to that.

Instead, it serves as a starting point and example on how the code can be structured for a Godot project that uses F#.

As a result, there is not a lot of gameplay, but I think it has enough to serve as an example.

# Future

I very likely won't add many features to this version of my dungeoncrawler. I however will accept PR's and also plan to add CI so that this project also shows how to set that up.

Other than that: Feel free to explore the code, see how I did things and copy whatever style/functions you want.

# Special thanks:

[godot-fsharp-tools](https://github.com/willnationsdev/godot-fsharp-tools) : This Godot plugin makes integrating F# code with Godot a breeze as it automates the boilerplate.

[F# discord (unofficial)](https://discord.gg/w5BW3DUrEA) the guys here helped me A LOT while learning F#. SHOUT OUT TO THEM!
